# Progress

## What Works
- The basic blog functionality is in place.
- Eleventy can successfully build the site from the existing markdown files.
- The index page correctly lists all blog posts.
- Individual post pages are rendered correctly using the base layout.
- The "About Me" page has been created and linked in the navigation.
- The "Now" page has been created and linked in the navigation, with appropriate styling.
- Social connection links have been added to the footer as per "Change Request: BLOG-04".
- Dates on the homepage and individual blog posts are now correctly formatted using `luxon`, resolving previous build errors.
- The site now has a distinct visual identity with a unique color scheme and professional typography, as per "Change Request: BLOG-06".
- The comprehensive favicon set has been implemented, ensuring cross-browser compatibility as per "Change Request: BLOG-07".
- Post excerpts are now displayed on the homepage with improved styling as per "Change Request: BLOG-08".
- The Impressum (legal notice) page has been created and linked in the footer as per "Change Request: BLOG-09".
- The image `images/20250726-title-researche_img.png` is now correctly visible in the `posts/ais-growing-black-box-losing-sight-of-how-ai-thinks.md` post. The issue was resolved by removing a corrupted binary file from the `posts/` directory that was causing Eleventy build errors.
