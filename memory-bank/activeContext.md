# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- The immediate focus is on understanding the existing codebase and establishing a baseline for future development.
- This involves reviewing all existing files and documenting the project structure and technologies.
- Implementing visual and structural enhancements as per "Change Request: BLOG-01", "Change Request: BLOG-02", and "Change Request: BLOG-03".

## Recent Changes
- The memory bank has just been initialized.
- Core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been created.
- Implemented changes from "Change Request: BLOG-01":
    - Created `css/style.css`.
    - Modified `_includes/base.njk`.
    - Created `_includes/post.njk`.
    - Modified `index.md`.
    - Updated layouts for all posts in `posts/` directory.
    - Modified `.gitignore`.
    - Created `.eleventyignore` to exclude `Change Request_ BLOG-01.md` from Eleventy processing.
- Implemented changes from "Change Request: BLOG-02":
    - Created `about.md` with author introduction content.
    - Modified `_includes/base.njk` to include a navigation link to the "About" page.
    - Appended new CSS rules to `css/style.css` for header navigation and the "About" page layout.
    - Updated `.eleventyignore` to exclude `Change Request_ BLOG-02.md`.
- Implemented changes from "Change Request: BLOG-03":
    - Created `now.md` with content for the "Now" page.
    - Modified `_includes/base.njk` to include a navigation link to the "Now" page.
    - Appended new CSS rules to `css/style.css` for generic page content and "last updated" text.
    - Updated `.eleventyignore` to exclude `Change Request_ BLOG-03.md`.
- Implemented changes from "Change Request: BLOG-04":
    - Modified `_includes/base.njk` to add social connection links to the footer.
    - Appended new CSS rules to `css/style.css` for styling the social links and footer layout.
    - Updated `.eleventyignore` to exclude `Change Request_ BLOG-04.md`.

## Next Steps
- Verify the implemented changes by running the Eleventy development server.
- Update the memory bank to reflect the completion of "Change Request: BLOG-04".

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The current structure is simple and effective for a basic blog.
- Future work might involve adding more complex features like categories, tags, or a more sophisticated design.
- Addressed the Eleventy build error by excluding the change request markdown file from processing.
- Resolved the `undefined filter: safe` error by ignoring the `memory-bank/` directory in `.eleventyignore`.
- Fixed the `invalid range syntax` error in `index.md` by updating the date filter to use `"%d %B %Y"`.
