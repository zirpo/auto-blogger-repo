# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- The "About" page layout has been redesigned to correctly display the author's photo and bio.
- The homepage now features the latest post in a prominent section, with the remaining posts displayed in a grid below.

## Recent Changes
- Redesigned the "About" page by adding a two-column grid layout in `css/style.css` to fix image alignment issues.
- Implemented a "featured post" section on the homepage by modifying `index.md` to separate the latest post from the rest.
- Added CSS rules to `css/style.css` to style the new featured post section.
- Corrected a bug where the post list was not displaying correctly after implementing the featured post section.

## Next Steps
- The "About" page and homepage have been updated and are functioning correctly.
- The project is stable and ready for the next set of tasks.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The new featured post section improves the visual hierarchy of the homepage.
- The "About" page now has a more professional and readable layout.
