## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Future work might involve adding more complex features like categories, tags, or a more sophisticated design.
- Addressed Eleventy build errors by ensuring all `Change Request_ BLOG-XX.md` files are excluded from processing.
- Resolved the `undefined filter: safe` error by ignoring the `memory-bank/` directory in `.eleventyignore`.
- Fixed the `invalid range syntax` error in `index.md` by updating the date filter to use `"%d %B %Y"`.
- Implemented robust date formatting using `luxon` to resolve Netlify build errors and ensure consistent date display.
- Fixed template parsing errors by properly excluding entire `changes_done/` directory in `.eleventyignore`.
- Resolved dependency issues by ensuring all npm packages are properly installed.
