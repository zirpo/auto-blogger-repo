# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- The immediate focus is on understanding the existing codebase and establishing a baseline for future development.
- This involves reviewing all existing files and documenting the project structure and technologies.

## Recent Changes
- The memory bank has just been initialized.
- Core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been created.

## Next Steps
- Create the `progress.md` file to complete the core memory bank.
- Begin planning for any new features or changes requested by the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The current structure is simple and effective for a basic blog.
- Future work might involve adding more complex features like categories, tags, or a more sophisticated design.
