### **Change Request: BLOG-07**

Title: Implement Comprehensive Favicon Set for Cross-Browser Compatibility  
Author: AIficionado (Junior Developer)  
Date: 2025-07-23  
Status: Proposed

### **1\. Introduction & Rationale**

1.1. Current Situation  
The site currently uses a single SVG favicon. While modern, this approach can have inconsistent results and may not be supported by all browsers or devices (e.g., when saving a site to a mobile home screen). The initial attempt to use a hand-coded SVG also caused issues with the build tools.  
1.2. Problem Statement  
To ensure a consistent and professional brand presence across all platforms, a more comprehensive and robust favicon solution is needed. This involves using a set of generated icons in various formats and sizes as recommended by modern web standards.  
1.3. Proposed Solution  
This change request proposes replacing the single SVG favicon with a complete set of favicons generated by a service like favicon.io. The author will upload the entire folder of generated assets to the project root. This change request details the code modifications required to link to these assets correctly and ensure they are copied to the final build output.

### **2\. High-Level Description of Changes**

1. The developer will assume a folder named favicon\_files (or similar, as provided by the generator) has been placed in the project's root directory.  
2. The .eleventy.js configuration file will be updated to copy this entire folder to the \_site output directory during the build process.  
3. The \<head\> section in the \_includes/base.njk layout file will be updated to remove the old SVG link and add the new, comprehensive set of links pointing to the various icon files.

### **3\. Detailed Implementation Steps**

3.1. Prerequisite: Add Favicon Files  
The author will download the .zip file from favicon.io, unzip it, and place the resulting folder (e.g., favicon\_files) into the root of the project directory.  
3.2. File: .eleventy.js (Modify)  
Update the Eleventy configuration to copy the entire favicon folder to the output directory.  
**Add the following line within the module.exports function:**  
// ... inside module.exports

  // Passthrough copy for static assets  
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("css");  
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("images");  
    
  // \--- ADD THIS LINE \---  
  // (Assuming the folder is named 'favicon\_files')  
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("favicon\_files");

  return {  
//...

3.3. File: \_includes/base.njk (Modify)  
Update the \<head\> section to link to the new, comprehensive set of favicons.  
**Find and remove this line:**  
\<link rel="icon" href="/images/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml"\>

**In its place, add the following block of code. (Note: The paths assume the files are inside a favicon\_files directory in the root).**  
\<\!-- Favicon \--\>  
\<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/favicon\_files/apple-touch-icon.png"\>  
\<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon\_files/favicon-32x32.png"\>  
\<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon\_files/favicon-16x16.png"\>  
\<link rel="manifest" href="/favicon\_files/site.webmanifest"\>

### **4\. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)**

1. The website builds successfully without errors.  
2. The new "z" favicon is visible and correctly displayed in the browser tab on desktop.  
3. When viewing the site on a mobile device, the correct favicon appears.  
4. If the site is added to an iOS or Android home screen, the apple-touch-icon or android-chrome icon is used.  
5. All links to the favicon files are correct and do not result in 404 errors.

### **5\. Potential Risks & Mitigation**

* **Risk:** The name of the uploaded favicon folder does not match the one in the code (favicon\_files).  
  * **Mitigation:** The developer must ensure the folder name used in .eleventy.js and \_includes/base.njk exactly matches the name of the folder uploaded by the author. This should be confirmed before implementation.
