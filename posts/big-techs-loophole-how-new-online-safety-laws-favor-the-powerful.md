# Big Tech's Loophole: How New Online Safety Laws Favor the Powerful

![ALT-TEXT Placeholder](/images/20250813-sex-is-getting-scrubbed-from-the-internet-but-a-bi_img.png)


The uneven application of new online safety laws creates problems.  Big tech companies benefit, while smaller players struggle. The internet shows a strange contrast. Teen girls find it hard to get good information about puberty.  Harmful content is easy to find. Yet, expensive AI-made explicit content is readily available. This isn't a simple problem.  It shows how unfair online safety rules are.  These laws aim to protect users. However, they mostly help large tech companies. Smaller companies struggle to comply.  This is about more than censorship.  It's about power and resources. Broad laws don't work well in a fast-changing world. We need a fairer online world for everyone.


## The Double Standard of Compliance

Large tech firms like xAI or Meta easily avoid online safety rules. They have many lawyers and lobbyists.  They can use technology to get around the rules. Smaller companies and creators face huge problems. They lack the money for lawyers or good technology.  Harmful AI-made content is easy to find. This is a big risk.  Different places have different rules.  Large companies exploit these differences.  AI-generated content grows fast. This makes the problem worse for everyone.  This isn't an accident. It's due to unequal power.


## The Role of Resources and Political Clout

Big companies avoid rules because they have money and power. They have many lawyers. They sue and appeal rulings. They lobby to change laws. They hire lobbyists to influence lawmakers.  Compliance is expensive. Smaller players can't afford it. This forces them to limit content or leave online.  This hurts creativity and choice.  It also harms online safety.  It lets a few powerful companies control things.


## The Consequences of Uneven Regulation

This unfair system has many bad effects. Smaller creators leave the internet. Harmful content spreads easily.  Innovation is hurt. People are less trusting of online platforms.  [cite a specific example of harm caused by this power imbalance, e.g., the disproportionate impact of content moderation policies on marginalized communities, or the spread of disinformation during a major political event] shows this clearly. We need better online safety rules.


## Key Takeaways and a Call to Action

Unfair online safety rules help big tech companies. They exploit loopholes and control the internet. This is about power. The system is flawed. It helps big companies and hurts everyone else. We need fairer rules. They must protect users and promote a healthy internet. We must fix the power imbalance. Regulations must be fair and apply to everyone. We need better transparency and accountability. Smaller companies need help complying with rules.  Only then will online safety truly work for everyone.
