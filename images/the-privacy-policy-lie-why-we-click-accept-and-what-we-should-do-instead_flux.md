## Core Description

A solitary figure, back to the camera, bound by chains forged from scrolling lines of illegible text, sits before a glowing computer screen.  The screen's surface is a chaotic field of indistinct, miniature forms reaching towards the figure.

## Technical Details

*   **Lighting:** Cool, neon-infused light emanating from the computer screen, casting long shadows and highlighting the intricate detail of the text chains.  Ambient light is low and moody.
*   **Composition:** A low-angle, slightly canted shot focusing on the figure's form and the chains, strategically obscuring the hands and fingers through framing and positioning.  Depth of field emphasizes the screen's chaotic surface.
*   **Color Scheme:** Predominantly cool blues and purples from the screen, contrasted with warm oranges and reds in the background, creating a sense of tension.  The chains are a muted grey-green.

## Conceptual Layers

*   **Conceptual Blend & Mood:** Juxtaposing the feeling of being trapped by overwhelming information with the oppressive, futuristic aesthetic of cyberpunk. The overall mood is one of isolation, anxiety, and a struggle against unseen forces.
*   **Depth & Layers:** Foreground: The figure's back and the text chains. Midground: The glowing computer screen with its myriad reaching forms. Background: A blurred, indistinct cityscape hinting at a vast, impersonal world.
