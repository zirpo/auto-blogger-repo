## Conceptual Layers

* **Conceptual Blend & Mood:**  The juxtaposition of chaos (the tangled yarn) and order (the neat coil) symbolizes the transformation from unclear to clear writing.  The overall mood is one of thoughtful precision and accomplishment.
* **Depth & Layers:**  Foreground: The perfectly formed yarn coil. Midground: A slight separation before the blurred, chaotic tangle in the background. Background:  The out-of-focus, tangled yarn representing the initial state of confusion.
