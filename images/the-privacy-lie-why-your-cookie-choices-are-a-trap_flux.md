A solitary, vulnerable figure stands teetering precariously on a shimmering digital platform, which itself is the disintegrating facade of a "privacy consent" banner, its surface riddled with deep, expanding cracks. Below these fissures, an infinite, dark digital abyss yawns, from which a mesmerizing vortex of luminous personal data streams is aggressively siphoned upwards. A multitude of abstract, predatory digital tendrils and shadowy mechanical arms writhe out of the chasm, each grasping and pulling the data into a colossal, unseen network that looms just beyond the frame. The entire scene is rendered in a high-contrast, neo-noir digital art style, imbued with an overwhelming sense of chilling deception and pervasive technological dread.
