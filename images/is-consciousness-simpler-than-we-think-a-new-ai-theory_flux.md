Visualize a vibrant, pulsating 'proto-algorithm', an almost biological, embryonic spark of pure consciousness, glowing brilliantly at the conceptual core of an immense, intricately radiant cybernetic neural labyrinth. This vast digital structure unfurls into an infinite digital void, meticulously crafted from countless interconnecting data streams, shimmering holographic projections, and razor-sharp crystalline logic gates that crisscross in a sublime network. The entire composition is bathed in an ethereal, deep bioluminescent glow, creating a mystical atmosphere where subtle digital distortion gently undulates along the edges of the frame. This scene should be rendered as a breathtaking piece of futuristic concept art with a profound sense of awe, blending elements of organic sci-fi illustration and advanced abstract digital design, emphasizing the wondrous and profound connection between nascent organic origins and highly advanced synthetic intelligence.
