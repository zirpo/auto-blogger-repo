A hyper-realistic digital art piece captures a breathtakingly intricate and luminous crystalline neural network core, dramatically suspended mid-implosion within a vast, dark digital void. Its once-pristine, geometric structure violently ruptures, shattering into a chaotic blizzard of brilliant algorithmic noise and razor-sharp glitched data shards that explode outwards with frantic energy. This internal devastation is intensified by an external, malignant invasion: a swarm of glowing, predatory pop-up advertisements and shimmering, viral cryptocurrency logos aggressively twist and burrow into the core, like insidious digital parasites, their vibrant, intrusive forms overwhelming and consuming its intelligence with a malevolent, suffocating presence, all illuminated by dramatic, high-contrast lighting that emphasizes the chaotic brilliance against the oppressive, infinite darkness.
