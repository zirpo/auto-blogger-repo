## Core Description

A lone arm, powerfully built, extends towards a glowing computer screen displaying a single, stark "Reject" button. The arm's silhouette is sharply defined against a deep, inky background.

## Technical Details

*   **Lighting:** Dramatic chiaroscuro, with a single, intense light source highlighting the arm and the "Reject" button, leaving the background in deep shadow. Cool blues and violets dominate the screen and shadowed areas, while a warm amber light emphasizes the arm.
*   **Composition:** Wide shot, focusing on the arm and the screen, maintaining a significant negative space around the arm to enhance its visual impact.  The camera angle is slightly low, looking up at the arm.  Avoid showing the hand itself; instead, focus on the powerful musculature of the forearm and upper arm.
*   **Color Scheme:** Cool blues and violets in the background, contrasting with warm amber and ochre highlights on the arm and button.


## Conceptual Layers

*   **Conceptual Blend & Mood:** Juxtaposition of individual agency ("Reject" button) against the overwhelming forces of data collection and manipulation (shadowy figures implied in the background).  The overall mood is one of defiance and tension.
*   **Depth & Layers:** Foreground: The powerfully muscled arm; Midground: The glowing computer screen with the "Reject" button; Background: Implied shadowy figures and a deep, atmospheric void representing the unseen forces of data control.
