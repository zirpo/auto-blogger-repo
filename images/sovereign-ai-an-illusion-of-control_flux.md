A charismatic national leader stands with a confident, almost defiant pose before a colossal, obsidian-like AI supercomputer, its sleek, monolithic surface subtly integrating national symbols and pulsating with an internal, soft light, all housed within a vast, dimly lit, brutalist-cyberpunk government data chamber illuminated by dramatic, high-contrast lighting. From the supercomputer's core, an intricate network of vibrant, organic, bioluminescent tendrils extends and subtly intertwines with the national symbols, ultimately coalescing into an ethereal, yet subtly ominous, non-corporate, foreign sigil that looms silently in the shadowed background, visually representing a hidden external influence, with the leader remaining completely unaware of this insidious, glowing network, creating a powerful juxtaposition rendered in a cinematic, hyperrealistic style with an overall ethereal glow.
