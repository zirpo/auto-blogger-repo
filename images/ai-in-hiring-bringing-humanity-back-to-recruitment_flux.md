## Core Description
Two individuals, a recruiter and a candidate, are engaged in a focused, empathetic conversation across a pristine, translucent desk, while an abstract, intelligent light network and digital data patterns seamlessly unfold in the deep background.

## Artistic References
*   A blend of neo-futurist architectural design and the nuanced humanism found in Edward Hopper's interior scenes.
*   The vibrant, atmospheric lighting and visual storytelling of a Ridley Scott cinematic production.
*   Clean, minimalist aesthetics reminiscent of contemporary interactive museum installations.

## LoRA Triggers
*   `v3ctora style`
*   `style of 80s cyberpunk`

## Technical Details
*   **Lighting:** Soft, directional key lighting illuminates the subjects' faces, contrasting with the ambient, shifting neon glows and luminous data streams emanating from the background network. The clear desk subtly refracts and reflects light, creating ethereal patterns.
*   **Composition:** A medium shot, framed at eye-level or a slight low-angle, focusing on the upper torsos and expressive faces of the recruiter and candidate. The composition employs either a three-quarter profile or a subtle over-the-shoulder angle for both subjects to naturally avoid the explicit depiction of hands and fingers, emphasizing their expressions and interaction. The translucent desk acts as a clean horizontal divider.
*   **Color Scheme:** A primary palette of cool blues, purples, and electric neons for the digital background, offset by warmer, more natural skin tones and subtle earthy or neutral tones in the subjects' clothing, suggesting a balance between technology and humanity.

## Conceptual Layers
*   **Conceptual Blend & Mood:** Juxtaposing deep human connection and empathetic dialogue with the pervasive, silent efficiency of an advanced artificial intelligence network, creating a mood of contemplative integration and human-centric progress.
*   **Depth & Layers:** In the foreground, the recruiter and candidate, intensely focused. The midground features the clear desk, potentially with subtle, integrated holographic interface elements. The deep background is entirely occupied by the luminous, abstract intelligent light and digital network, moving in fluid, organic patterns, providing an uncluttered yet sophisticated environment.
