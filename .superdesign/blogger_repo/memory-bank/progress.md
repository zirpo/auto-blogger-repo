- Individual post pages are rendered correctly using the base layout.
- The "About Me" page has been created and linked in the navigation, and its layout has been redesigned for a professional appearance.
- The "Now" page has been created and linked in the navigation, with appropriate styling.
- Social connection links have been added to the footer as per "Change Request: BLOG-04".
