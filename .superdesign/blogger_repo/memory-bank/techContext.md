# Tech Context

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js:** The runtime environment for Eleventy.
- **Eleventy (@11ty/eleventy):** The static site generator.
- **Nunjucks:** The templating language.
- **Markdown:** The content format.
- **Git:** For version control.
- **npm:** For package management.

## Development Setup
- To run the project locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Run the development server with `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`.
- The generated site is in the `_site` directory.

## Technical Constraints
- The project is designed to be a static site, so there is no server-side logic or database.
- All content is managed through markdown files.

## Dependencies
- The only development dependency is `@11ty/eleventy`.
