# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to provide a simple, no-fuss blogging platform that is easy to manage and publish to.

## Problems It Solves
- Simplifies the process of creating and publishing blog posts.
- Avoids complex content management systems.
- Allows for version control of content by using markdown files in a git repository.

## How It Should Work
- Users create new markdown files in the `posts` directory.
- Each markdown file represents a single blog post.
- The Eleventy build process automatically generates the corresponding HTML pages.
- The main page lists all available posts.

## User Experience Goals
- The primary user is the content creator/author.
- The authoring experience should be as simple as writing a markdown file.
- The final website should be fast and easy to navigate for readers.
