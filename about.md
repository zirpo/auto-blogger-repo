    <h2>My Why</h2>
    <p>Like many, I had a 'ChatGPT moment'â€”a spark that reconnected me with the joy of building and creating, showing me how AI can empower anyone to turn ideas into reality. This experience fuels my core belief: we are at the dawn of a profoundly better future, one where technology can help us tackle humanity's greatest challenges.</p>
    <p>My goal here is to serve as a chronicler of this incredible transition. I champion progress and automation, but with a critical condition: the immense value generated must be channeled back to support a just and equitable society. This isn't about halting innovation; it's about steering it responsibly.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, I believe that as AI's capabilities constantly improve, so should our wisdom in applying them. This blog is my way of exploring that parallel journey.</p>
